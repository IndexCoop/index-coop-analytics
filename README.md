# Analytics Working Group

## AWG Overview

Welcome! This is the documentation for the **Index Coop Analytics Working Group** (AWG). The [Index Coop](https://discord.gg/4XBGHBKxdU) is a product-focused DAO building crypto index products for specific market segments. AWG supports all initiatives across the Index Coop including product, treasury, growth, governance, liquidity, and metrics.

The Coop prides itself on being data-driven. Data is one of the lifebloods of efficient collaboration and decision-making within a DAO. The Coop must operate from a foundation of facts and truth, and the AWG will work to make sure that is always the case.

We are at the forefront of learning how to support a DAO with data and analytics. DAO analytics groups are not common, but we believe that analytics is a functional advantage for a DAO. The AWG is an iterative experiment to learn how to best support the DAO with best-in-class analytics.

## New Contributors

New contributors are always welcome. Impactful contributions will be rewarded by the Index Coop (in the form of the INDEX token). If you are interested in contributing, please reach out to @jdcook#7279 on Discord or ping the #analytics channel in the Index Coop Discord [server](https://discord.gg/4XBGHBKxdU).

## Workflow

The majority of analytics work is done on [Dune](https://dune.xyz) and we use GitHub to manage our projects and code. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-coop-analytics).

1. New ideas and requests are created as **Issues** and land in the **Intake** column of the [Projects Board](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-coop-analytics/projects/1)
2. If an issue is prioritized, it moves to **Scoping** where more description is added and any details or documentation needed to complete the issue is added.
3. Once an issue is scoped out, it moves to **On Deck** to wait for someone to work on it.
4. If an issue is actively being worked on, it moves to **In Progress.** The person working on the issue will open a **Pull Request** set into 'draft mode.' All communication regarding the Issue should take place in the Issue itself, or in the Pull Request.
5. When an issue is complete, it is moved to **In Review**. All issues should spend some time in here to be reviewed by stakeholders and other analysts.
6. Once an issue has been reviewed and has been delivered, the issue is moved to **Completed** and closed.

## Repository

1. Fork this [repository](https://github.com/IndexCoop/index-coop-analytics) and clone it to your local machine. 
2. Set this repository as the remote upstream
3. Work on your local and push to your remote origin, and create Pull Requests back to this repository.

[Here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) are some basic instructions on the Fork & Pull Request Workflow.

The root-level contains a folder for each of the core lanes across Index Coop:

* KPIs
* Growth
* Treasury 
* Product
* Governance

Each issue should fall under one of these areas, so it would warrant creating a new folder inside that lane’s directory. If it is a task for a specific product (ex: DPI) then a new folder should be created inside the `dpi` folder in `product`. Inside each of the core folders is a `dune-queries` folder - all standalone dune queries related to that lane should live there.

All Dune query files should have the link to the Dune query at the top of the file. If the issue itself is a Dune Dashboard, append “-dash” to the end of the folder name.
