# Index Coop Analytics

## Analytics Working Group

Welcome! This repository supports the Index Coop Analytics Working Group (AWG). The [Index Coop](https://discord.gg/4XBGHBKxdU) is a product-focused DAO building crypto index products for specific market segments. AWG supports all initiatives across the Index Coop: product, treasury, growth, governance, liquidity, and metrics. 

The Coop prides itself on being data-driven. Data is one of the life-bloods of efficient collaboration and decision making within a DAO. The Coop must operate from a foundation of facts and truth, and the AWG will work to make sure that is always the case.

## Contributing

New contributors are always welcome. Impactful contributions will be rewarded by the Index Coop (in the form of INDEX token). A major reason for this repoâ€™s existence is the help manage the contributions from many people in an efficient and transparent way.

Please read through CONTRIBUTING for a primer on how to start contributing, as well as the organization of the project.

## Regarding DAO Analytics

We are on the forefront of learning how to best support a DAO with data and analytics. DAO analytics groups are not common, but we have a belief that analytics can be a functional advantage for a DAO. The AWG is an iterative experiment to learn how to best support the DAO with best-in-class analytics.
