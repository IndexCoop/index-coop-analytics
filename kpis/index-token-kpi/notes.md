My Python conda virtual environment can be setup with the provided environment.yaml file. Of note, the machine I'm on is Windows 10 and AMD CPU (rarely an issue but packages differ on Anaconda Cloud). 

The indexTokenKPIs.ipynb notebook can be easily rerun from start to finish if you have the required packages. All one needs to change is the date range in one of the first few cells. There should be comments just above this pointing at this specific code cell. This script is meant to be less of a showcase and more of a rerunnable script; I've deleted any comments with conclusions that I don't think will hold up over time and turned them into statements that will print out a readable conclusion/interpretation of the data.  

The oneTimeShowcase_date... files are for presenting the data (as pretty as a Jupyter Notebook gets) but aren't runnable.
